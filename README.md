This is a comment of game [*Kind Words*](https://steamcommunity.com/app/1070710), in which 'players' can write nice letters to real people. The concept deeply impressed our team. 
Inspried by which, we plan to build **a web application that collects and shares kind words**. 
A user can receive and share one message every day. The message can be a small paragraph, a quote, a simple line, or even a single word. 

Everyone faces a lot of pressure every day, from schools or the workplace. One never stops, and cannot stop despite all kinds of frustrations and difficulties. We would like to build a cyber-sanctuary for each and every individual, infusing positive power and spreading kindness to the world.
