This is a comment of game [*Kind Words*](https://steamcommunity.com/app/1070710), in which 'players' can write nice letters to real people. The concept deeply impressed our team. 
Inspried by which, we plan to build **a mobile/web application that collects and shares kind words**. 
A user can receive and share one message every day. The message can be a small paragraph, a quote, a simple line, or even a single word. 

Everyone faces a lot of pressure every day, from schools or the workplace. One never stops, and cannot stop despite all kinds of frustrations and difficulties. We would like to build a cyber-sanctuary for each and every individual, infusing positive power and spreading kindness to the world. 

Also we want to keep both the senders and the receiver anonymous to each other. Kindness from a stranger can sometimes cheer one up more in their difficult times. However, everyone can see how many times their messages have been shared to others. We hope every user will gain a sence of achievement and motive to make the world less indifferent.

## Target User
This app does not have a specific group of target users. Anyone who is willing to offer and receive kindness and encouragements is welcome to this small community. 

## Funtionalities
- Daily Message\* (Receiving)
- Timing (Daily / Every time you need a cheerup)
- Subscribing (Login / By Email)
- Sending 
- Sharing (via social media)


## Scope
The project is front-end based, with the back-end storing all the user information and messages we got. Beyond, automatic email subscription and connections to third-party apps need to be implemented. Expecting a team of size 4-5 since we wnat to make the app tiny but elegent and funtional.
